# Beepy CLI
Your one-stop-shop for all things Beepy, as long as all things means:
going from zero to messaging with Beeper on your device, or copying logs
from your Beepy to your computer (actually that second bit is coming
soon).

## Download
*Coming soon*: fetch the latest binary from GitHub releases or actions.

Alternatively, you can build it yourself by cloning the repo and running
`go build .`. Building requires Go 1.20 or higher.

`beepy` supports amd64 and arm64 on Linux and macOS. Windows is not
supported natively, please use WSL.

## Usage
To log in to your Beeper account and install `gomuks`—the Beeper client
for Beepy—all you have to do is run `beepy`.

To copy logs from your Beepy device to your laptop, run `beepy --logs`.
Once that works, that is.
